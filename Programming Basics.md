We shall begin with a question, the most fundamental and clique question to have ever been asked: 
_"What is Programming?"_

In  my opinion that's a very broad and open-ended question.
Here are what i believe to be the better questions

1. What is a Programming Language?
2. What is the purpose they solve?
3. How do they interact with a computer?
4. How does this language scale to Web Applications and Data Processes?

Let's  begin, 
==from here onwards, please make your own notes.==

##### Q1.  What is a Programming language?

To  answer this, we will first understand how a computer executes any thing.
See to a computer  everything is an instruction. The CPU or **C**entral **P**rocessing **U**nit, is a complex circuit that can do logical operations like AND, OR, NAND etc. these allow us to perform both logical and mathematical operations.
Now, a programming language is like a buffer between you and the  assembly / binary that you would need to write to otherwise make the CPU do said task.
